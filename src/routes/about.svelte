<h1><code>about=&#123;learning-new-languages&#125;</code></h1>

<p>
  The world of computer programming is stuffed with languages which is an
  inspiring mark of human creativity yet with overwhelming side-effects. Being a
  front-end dev in the world of HTML/CSS/JS doesn't necessarily mean one can
  escape having to learn these languages, with their varied syntaxes, since they
  exist to facilitate project-realization and making CSS and JavaScript
  browser-ready. It seems as soon as we get good at one, there's a new arrival
  that is better and faster and the new norm among professional programmers.

<p>
  With the arrival of Svelte, we yet again embark on this journey. But some how
  it feels different. It feels lighter like when you move from one house to
  another and you get rid of all those books, clothes, and appliances you don't
  use anymore. It feels more creative like when you discovered how a
  pencil-to-paper was a quicker and more sufficient way to get your ideas down.
