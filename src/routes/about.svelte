<h1><code>about=&#123;learning-new-languages&#125;</code></h1>

<p>
  The world of computer programming is overflowing with languages! This is an
  inspiring mark of human creativity yet simultanesouly overwhelming. Being a
  front-end dev in the world of HTML/CSS/JS doesn't mean we are confined to just
  HTML/CSS/JS. To facilitate project-realization, many libraries have flooded
  the market in order to make CSS and JavaScript browser-ready and so many
  syntaxes have also deluged us. It seems as soon as we get good at one, there's
  a new arrival that is better and faster and then becomes the norm (hopefully longer than a couple years)
  among programmers.

<p>
  With the arrival of Svelte, we yet again embark on this journey. But somehow
  it feels different. It feels <em>lighter</em> like when you move from one house to
  another and you get rid of all those books, clothes, furniture, and appliances
  you don't use anymore. It feels faster. It feels familiar. Its feels less
  intrusive and opinionated. And all in all, it enables more creativity!
